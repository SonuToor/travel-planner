## Travel Planner

This travel planner is a tool for any traveller who feels overwhelmed when initially crafting their itinerary.

This Web App allows a user to choose a destination, choose their dates, then input events and reservation info pertaining to their trip. That information is then stored and displayed for the user so they can always stay ontop of things during their trip.

It is built using React.js and with Material-UI. Google Firebase is employed for authentication as well as storing the information regarding a users itinerary. 

## Get Started 

In the project directory:

1. npm / yarn install
2. npm / yarn start
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Next Steps
A new feature that is being considered is the ability to export (syncing) the user's itinerary (individual events) to Google Calendar.
