## Travel Planner
This travel planner is a tool for any traveller who feels overwhelmed when initially crafting their itinerary.

This Web App allows a user to choose a destination, choose their dates, then input events and reservation info pertaining to their trip. That information is then stored and displayed for the user so they can always stay ontop of things during their trip. 

It is built using React.js and with Material-UI. Google Firebase is employed for authentication as well as storing the information regarding a users itinerary. It also has integration with the Google Calendars API so you can export your itinerary and have it with you anywhere you go!
